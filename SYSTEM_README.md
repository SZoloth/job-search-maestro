## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Research Prompts

Create company-specific research by modifying AI prompts:

```python
# Add custom industry analysis
research_engine = AIResearchEngine()
research = research_engine.research_company(
    "TechCorp", 
    "Senior PM",
    specific_focus="AI implementation strategy"
)
```

### Pipeline Management

Track multiple opportunities:

```python
# View all active opportunities
orchestrator = JobSearchOrchestrator()
pipeline_status = orchestrator.get_pipeline_status()

# Update opportunity status
orchestrator.update_opportunity("Canva", "interviewed", notes="Great cultural fit")
```

### Email Campaign Optimization

Monitor and optimize email performance:

```python
# Track email campaign success
email_system = ColdEmailSystem()
campaign_metrics = email_system.get_campaign_metrics("Canva")

# A/B test email templates
email_system.test_template_variants("growth_focused", "ai_focused")
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Research Quality
- **Execute AI prompts manually** for highest quality insights
- **Use NotebookLM** to convert research into audio for better retention
- **Cross-reference multiple sources** to validate findings
- **Focus on recent developments** (last 6 months priority)

### Application Quality
- **Keyword optimization** without overstuffing (80%+ match target)
- **Quantified outcomes** in every major bullet point
- **Company-specific terminology** integration
- **ATS-friendly formatting** with clear section headers

### Email Effectiveness
- **Plain language only** - no buzzwords or corporate speak
- **Under 200 words** with clear, specific ask
- **One follow-up maximum** after exactly 7 days
- **LinkedIn connection** same day as email send

### Interview Preparation
- **Company-specific question banks** for each interview
- **STAR responses** practiced and timed (2-3 minutes each)
- **Interviewer research** for question prediction
- **Strategic questions prepared** that demonstrate business understanding

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Low response rates:**
- Check email validation against rules (word count, clarity, ask)
- Verify LinkedIn connection degree (1st/2nd preferred)
- Review personalization quality and company research depth

**Generic application materials:**
- Increase keyword optimization from job descriptions
- Add more company-specific research findings
- Enhance value proposition relevance to role

**Interview preparation gaps:**
- Expand case story repository with quantified outcomes

### Getting Help

- **Configuration issues**: Check `config/job_search_config.json` format
- **Template customization**: Modify files in `templates/` directory
- **AI prompt optimization**: Test prompts manually before automation
- **Pipeline tracking**: Use `python job_search_orchestrator.py track`
